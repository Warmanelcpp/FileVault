# 🔐 File Encryption and Decryption Tool (C++)

A simple and effective C++ application that encrypts and decrypts files using XOR-based encryption. Designed as a university project, this tool demonstrates basic file I/O, binary data handling, and encryption logic — great for learning and real use!

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔒 Encrypt any file using XOR encryption
- 🔓 Decrypt using the same key
- 📁 Works with all file types (text, binary, images, etc.)
- 💡 Simple, menu-based interface
- 🧠 Great for beginners learning file handling and encryption

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Clone this repo** or download the `.cpp` file:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-encryption-tool.git

2. Open the project in Dev C++ or your preferred C++ IDE.

3. Compile and run the app:

    Open main.cpp

    Press F11 (Compile & Run in Dev C++)

4. Follow the on-screen menu:

    Enter the filename to encrypt/decrypt

    Enter the output filename

    Enter a single character as the encryption key

⚠️ Important: Keep the key safe — you'll need the same key to decrypt the file.

## 📂 Example

- 🔐 Encrypt a file:
- Input file: message.txt
- Output file: secret.enc
- Key: X

- 🔓 Decrypt a file:
- Input file: secret.enc
- Output file: restored.txt
- Key: X
